[{"id":1,"title":"Soumkine Notebooks","description":"For almost 20 years I work as an illustrator and graphic designer. \nEach new project starts with sketches in my notebooks. To record any idea you need a good support to write or sketch out.\n\nOver this time I have tried all kinds of notebooks; everything from cheap school notepads to premium class diaries. One day I realised no notebooks existed to meet these conditions, so I created my own. The Soumkine Notebook.\n\nFurthermore, I created a stationery company Soumkine Notebooks that focuses on high quality hand-made notebooks with premium paper.\n\nSoumkine — It's my last name in the French manner. It pronounces as [sum’kin].\n\nP.S. Next time I will tell more about the Soumkine identity and especially about the logo. But today I can't wait to present the last collection of \"A5 Slim\" notebooks. By the way, they are all available in our online shop Soumkine.com, so don't miss out! ","filename":"d595f541911437.Y3JvcCwxMjcyLDk5Niw2NSww.jpg","src":"https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/projects/original/d595f541911437.Y3JvcCwxMjcyLDk5Niw2NSww.jpg"},{"id":2,"title":"Calendar 2019 / Limited Edition","description":"New Calendar for 2019, incl. lots of new artworks from the last 12 months.
